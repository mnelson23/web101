PreWork

In WEB101, each week you're going to be working towards creating a single page website focused on social impact for good. We define social impact for good to mean the ways and means by which members of a community can bring about change for societal good. This through-course project will give you the opportunity to create a web app centered on a cause you are passionate about. By the end of the course, you'll have an interactive website that connects your topic with all of the skills you've learned in the class
